GSN Challenge Game is a game in Unity that was made while collaborating with a specialty chemical producer company named Clariant which focuses on allowing players to make various environmental sustainability choices on an interactive map (Game was made in a team of 5 and the project work lasted from January-April 2024, where I worked on implementing the game map and UI of various in-game menus along with the functionality of placing and converting objects on the game map, and my team overall helped with setting up the foundation and basic functions of the game for future teams to build on since the game isn't fully complete)
