GSN Challenge Game is a game in Unity that was made while collaborating with a specialty chemical producer company named Clariant which focuses on allowing players to make various environmental sustainability choices on an interactive map (Game was made in a team of 5, where I worked on implementing
the game map and UI of various in-game menus game map along with the functionality of placing and converting objects on the game map)
